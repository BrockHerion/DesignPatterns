# Head First Design Patterns - C\#

Head First Design Patterns is a fantastic look at the various design patterns used in Object Oriented Programming. The samples in book were all written in Java, which is fine, but I myself prefer C\# for an OO language.

Thus, I have taken it upon myself to do the book examples in .NET 6 and C\# instead of Java. My solutions are free to be cloned, picked at, and experimented with. Enjoy!
